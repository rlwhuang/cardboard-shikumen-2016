cardboard shikumen

cardboard shikumen is a project aiming to preserve the heritages of the traditional [Shikumen](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikumen) architecture in Shanghai, by capturing 360-degree panoramic photos and videos of Shikumen neighbourhoods scheduled for demolition and presenting the footage in a web-based virtual reality environment that is accessible for anyone running a relatively modern web browser. 

This repository holds the code for the cardboard shikumen virtual reality viewer, which is based on [a-frame](aframe.io), an open source framework for creating WebVR experiences. The cardboard shikumen viewer uses [clock position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_position) to define links between different panoramas, allowing users without much technical expertise to modify the viewer to display their own panorama footages.
